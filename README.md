Silverkube - a kubernetes service for desktop
=============================================

The goal is to provide a kubernetes service suitable to manage
a desktop workstation:

* Minimal services to be started early
* Basic auth enough to let a container starts more container

The build.py script generates a package to be installed.
The silverkube.py script starts the services.
